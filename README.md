### About
Chartfolio is a cryptocurrency portfolio webapp that has been designed to
extract data from exchanges and display it in a centralized manner. This is
a highly custom piece of software that would require much adaptation to re-use.

### Exchanges
Currently Chartfolio supports three exchanges:
* Binance/Binance.US
* Bybit
* FTX/FTX.US

Other exchanges will likely never be added.

### Attribution
All of the research materials that were needed to make this possible are listed
